"""Content-addressed disk cache for memory-mapped dataset files.

Re-runs whose input bytes, tokenizer identity, and prompt/input settings are
byte-identical reuse the previously-tokenized ``dataset.dat`` / ``index.dat``
pair instead of re-tokenizing from scratch.

Cache key inputs:
    - sha256 of the input file bytes (None if no file -- e.g. synthetic)
    - public_dataset name (e.g. "openai/openai_humaneval") if any
    - custom_dataset_type (e.g. "mooncake_trace") if any
    - tokenizer identity tuple: (name, revision, trust_remote_code, apply_chat_template)
    - input/prompt config dump that affects tokenization or layout, including
      num_conversations, num_dataset_entries, sampling_strategy, and the entire
      ``input.prompt`` config (excluding the cache_bust subtree -- see below)
    - canonical AIPerf build identity (commit SHA when available, else package version)

Cache-bust deliberately does NOT enter the key. The mmap holds template bytes
that the worker re-randomizes per-request, so two runs with different
cache_bust settings can safely share the same cached mmap.

On-disk layout::

    <cache_dir>/<key>/
        dataset.dat         # mmap data file (or .dat.zst when compress_only)
        index.dat           # mmap index file (or .dat.zst when compress_only)
        manifest.json       # orjson; version + side-data needed to skip the composer

``inputs.json`` is intentionally not cached: cache-served datasets skip
``inputs.json`` generation (or would just re-dump the verbatim source), and
legacy entries that still set ``has_inputs_json`` are resolved on lookup only.

Concurrency: writers populate to ``<cache_dir>/<key>.tmp.<pid>`` and atomically
``os.replace`` the directory into place. A reader that finds a partial entry
(missing manifest.json) treats the entry as a MISS and overwrites it.

Manifest version:
    Bumped whenever the on-disk layout, the side-data schema, or the decoded
    content the loaders produce for a given key changes. Mismatches are treated
    as a MISS.

# loaders produce for a given key changes -- the key has no source-code
# component, so a content-semantics fix must bump this or warm caches keep
# serving the old (wrong) dataset. Version 7 invalidates entries built before
# the weka context-loss rule (a turn whose truncation removes every user
# segment now resumes at a USER turn instead of opening with a fabricated
# assistant segment -- role boundaries moved for seam/reset re-emits).
# Version 6 invalidates entries built before
# the weka subagent hash_id-scope fix (subagents now share the parent trace's
# scope, so shared blocks decode to different tokens than v5 produced).
# Version 5 fixed the Conversation.metadata() projection of per-turn
# theoretical prefix-cache block counts for realtime infinite-cache hit rate.
MANIFEST_VERSION = (
    # v27: streaming chat/completions payloads now always carry
    # stream_options.include_usage, not just when use_server_token_count is set
    # (vLLM only emits the trailing usage chunk -- which carries per-request
    # spec-decode metrics -- when it is present). Under PREFORMAT_PAYLOADS the
    # payload bytes are baked at build time, and the key's preformat_endpoint
    # dict is unchanged for a streaming + use_server_token_count=False run, so
    # a warm entry would keep serving payloads without the field.
    # v26: weka inter-turn delays are now always end-to-start
    # (t_k - (t_{k-1} + api_{k-1}), floored at 0) instead of start-to-start.
    # The use_end_to_start_delays flag was removed, so Turn.delay decodes to
    # different values for the same key. The flag's removal from the key payload
    # already forces old weka entries to miss, but the content changed, so bump
    # explicitly per this file's contract rather than relying on that coincidence.
    # v25: same-model reduction sidecars are still classified as auxiliary for
    # scheduling, but no longer emit the extra reduction session-id flavor.
    # They now use plain ::aux:, so cached Weka manifests need rebuilt session
    # ids.
    # v24: Weka source provenance now includes source_inner_idx for nested
    # subagent child requests. Cached manifests produced before v24 deserialize
    # with None for that field, so request exports cannot deep-link exact
    # raw+inner source coordinates even though replay bytes are otherwise
    # identical.
    # v23: Weka traces carry explicit api_time interval-frontier metadata in
    # DatasetMetadata (replay_scope_id + per-turn replay_predecessors). Cached
    # manifests produced before v23 deserialize with empty defaults, silently
    # disabling fan-out/join barriers even though dataset.dat remains usable.
    # Rebuild so the manifest sidecar contains the inferred dependency graph.
    # (HEAD reached v22 independently; this is the next free version.)
    # v22: cache key now (a) serializes osl_fallback / synthesis to JSON-native
    # dicts -- a raw pydantic model TypeError'd orjson.dumps and silently
    # disabled caching for any --osl trace run; (b) keys the FULL synthesis dump
    # (speedup_ratio + every *_multiplier, not just max_isl/max_osl); (c) keys
    # PREFORMAT_PAYLOADS (flips stored mmap FORMAT conversation<->payload_bytes);
    # and (d) hashes inline ``records:`` content (no input_file to hash, so two
    # inline datasets otherwise collided on one key). Invalidates pre-v22 entries.
    # v21: cache key now includes the weka join-seam knobs
    # (WEKA_SEAM_MAX_GAP_SECONDS / WEKA_SEAM_MIN_OVERLAP_RATIO). They gate
    # whether a far-future continuation is stitched onto an existing chain vs
    # spawned as a new conversation (detect_agent_chains), changing session
    # structure baked into the mmap -- omitting them served stale bytes when
    # they changed.
    # v20: cache key now includes random_seed / dataset_random_seed /
    # corpus (prompts.corpus) / osl_fallback. These bake into the decoded mmap
    # (base seed drives per-block hash_id token derivation; corpus + OSL
    # fallback select the reconstructed tokens), so omitting them let two runs
    # differing only in those serve each other's stale bytes. Invalidates
    # pre-v20 entries.
    # v19: worker-group grouping now requires BOTH a shared fork point AND
    # temporal overlap (the corpus research + graph adapter prescription:
    # overlapping intervals AND a shared prefix). Workers are scoped by fork
    # point, then split into connected components of overlapping [t0,t1)
    # intervals within each scope. Pure overlap alone bridged a busy trace into
    # one blob (a chain of overlaps spans the session); the fork-point scope
    # prevents that, and the overlap split drops fork-point members that never
    # run concurrently (e.g. a seam-re-keyed phantom fork). ::wg:{group}_{member}
    # membership changed.
    # v18: worker-group grouping re-keyed from hash_ids[0] (block-0) to the
    # fork point (fork.parent_chain + fork.fork_outer_idx) -- the deep spawn
    # relationship that actually identifies a coordinated fan-out. block-0 is the
    # shallow common root (~system prompt) shared by ~all of a session's workers,
    # so it lumped unrelated fan-outs into one coarse blob. The coordinate drops
    # to ::wg:{group}_{member} (the temporal burst is gone -- fork-point groups
    # are inherently time-tight), so ::wg: child session ids changed again.
    # WEKA_WORKER_GROUP_BURST_GAP_SECONDS removed from the cache key.
    # v17: worker-group session ids now encode the parallel-fan-out coordinate
    # as ::wg:{lineage}_{burst}_{member} (was ::wg:{NNN}). lineage = shared-
    # spawn-block group; burst = temporal dispatch wave split at
    # WEKA_WORKER_GROUP_BURST_GAP_SECONDS; member = index within the burst. Those
    # ::wg: child session ids changed; ::fa:/::aux: are unchanged.
    # v16: aux classification gained a reduction arm and worker-group tagging.
    # A same-model single-request large-input/short-output one-shot (context
    # compaction, subagent-result summary, tool-output digest) is now a sidecar
    # via WEKA_AUX_REDUCTION_*;
    # and a worker chain sharing a spawn block with >= WEKA_WORKER_GROUP_MIN
    # siblings and a deep fork is tagged ::wg: (parallel fan-out agent) instead
    # of the generic ::fa:, so those child session ids changed.
    # v15: aux classification gained a cross-model arm -- a one-shot worker
    # chain on a different model than its enclosing main chain (e.g. a Haiku
    # WebFetch summary under an Opus agent) is now a sidecar regardless of
    # payload size, so large cross-model singletons move ::fa: -> ::aux: (and
    # :fa: -> :aux: under subagents). Gated by WEKA_AUX_CROSS_MODEL.
    # v14: subagent nested-LCP overflow session ids restructured to match the
    # top-level vocabulary -- the agent marker is renamed and separated
    # (:cNNN -> :fa:NNN) and short, small-fresh-context overflow splits off as
    # sidecars (:aux:NNN), so those child session ids changed. Same WEKA_AUX_*
    # knobs; yardstick is the subagent's own main-chain peak ISL.
    # v13: flattened-agent worker chains that are short, small-fresh-context
    # one-shot calls are reclassified ::fa: -> ::aux: (auxiliary sidecars), so
    # those child session ids changed (::fa:{NNN} -> ::aux:{NNN}). Governed by
    # WEKA_AUX_MAX_REQUESTS / WEKA_AUX_ISL_RATIO / WEKA_AUX_ISL_FLOOR (also in
    # the cache key, so tuning them re-keys without a version bump).
    # v12: weka subagent inner requests split by nested LCP chain detection
    # instead of time-interval stream packing -- child session ids changed
    # (::sa:{agent_id} main chain + :c{NNN} spawned chains replace the
    # :s{i} streams), child counts and SPAWN branch memberships changed,
    # child turn timestamps moved to root-trace coordinates, and
    # spawned-chain turn-0 tool/system attribution is proof-gated.
    # v11: the system role is never fabricated from the observed
    # namespace-group prefix (0/0-declared chains bake all-user turn 0s) --
    # role boundaries changed again relative to v10.
    # v10: merge of the flattened-agent-splitting lineage and the
    # tool-shaping lineage (boundary-cut overhang strip; shaping decided at
    # first emission so reset re-emits reproduce the first-sent shape).
