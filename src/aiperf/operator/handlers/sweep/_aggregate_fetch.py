"""Harvest the cross-variation aggregate from a sweep-controller's sidecar.

The sweep-controller pod runs a results-sidecar (added in
``handlers/sweep/create.py``) that serves ``/results/`` over HTTP, gated by
the ``.aiperf_results_ready.json`` marker the controller writes after
aggregation. The pod itself uses ``emptyDir{}`` for ``/results``, so the
operator MUST pull the artifacts via the sidecar before the JobSet is
deleted — otherwise the per-sweep aggregate is lost on pod cleanup.

Symmetric with ``_completion_fetch.py`` (the AIPerfJob harvester) but
narrower in scope: there is exactly one host (the sweep-controller's
single replica), no checkpoint dance, and the destination is the
operator's PVC at ``<base>/<ns>/sweeps/<sweep>/<epoch>/`` so the
``getSweepEpochs`` / ``getSweepCells`` REST endpoints can read it.

The handler is transport-only: it never advances ``latest.txt``. The kopf
completion handler owns the durable archive commit after validating the full
downloaded file set.

    ``children.json``) — that path is already operator-mirror-shaped under
    its ``/results`` mount. Downloading to ``<base>`` (NOT the per-sweep
    epoch dir) re-roots the whole tree onto the operator's PVC at the
    expected ``<base>/<ns>/sweeps/<sweep>/<epoch>/aggregate.json`` location.
