class ProgressClient:
    """Async HTTP client for fetching job progress from controller pods.

    This client connects to the controller pod's HTTP API to retrieve
    real-time progress information during job execution. Includes retry
    logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.

    All public methods require the client to be entered as an async context
    manager; calling them outside of ``async with`` raises ``RuntimeError``.

    controller_host format:
        Every public method takes a ``controller_host`` string. In-cluster
        this is the fully qualified headless-service DNS name produced by
        :func:`aiperf.kubernetes.jobset.controller_dns_name`, of the form
        ``<jobset>-controller-0-0.<jobset>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local``
        (the leaf ``controller-0-0`` is the single controller replica's
        JobSet pod DNS). When port-forwarding from outside the cluster,
        ``localhost`` or any reachable IP/hostname is also accepted.

        When :attr:`K8sEnvironment.CONTROLLER_HTTP_URL_OVERRIDE` is set
        (chaos tests only), controller API-port requests ignore
        ``controller_host`` and go to the override URL instead. Sidecar-port
        clients still use direct pod DNS so salvage can bypass API-port faults.
        See :meth:`_base_url`.

    Example:
        >>> async with ProgressClient() as client:
        ...     progress = await client.get_progress(
        ...         "run-1234-controller-0-0.run-1234.aiperf.svc.cluster.local"
