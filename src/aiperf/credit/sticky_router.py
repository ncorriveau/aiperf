class StickyCreditRouter(CommunicationMixin):
    """Routes credits to workers with sticky sessions and fair load balancing.

    All messages between the Worker and TimingManager service flow through the CreditRouter.

    IMPORTANT:
        - This class has been highly optimized for performance, as it is a hot path.
        - Please be careful when making changes to ensure performance is not degraded.
        - All operations are atomic because there are no await calls between reads and writes.
        - Methods are intentionally large/inlined to avoid function call overhead in the hot path.
        - The class is designed for single-threaded asyncio use only.

    Credit Routing:
        - First turn → least-loaded worker (creates sticky session).
        - Subsequent turns → same worker via sticky session lookup.
        - Final turn → cleanup sticky session.

    Load Balancing:
        - Least-loaded worker selection for new sessions using fair load balancing
            - Determined by the worker(s) with the fewest in-flight credits.
        - Tie-breaking for multiple workers in this order:
            - `active_sessions`: Prefer workers with fewer committed multi-turn sessions
            - `virtual_sent_credits`: Prefer workers with fewer historical credits (virtual to handle
                late-joining workers fairly - they start at average, not zero)
            - `last_sent_at_ns`: Prefer workers with oldest send time (LRU-like fairness)

    Credit Returns:
        - All CreditReturns and FirstTokens flow through the CreditRouter and
          are forwarded via callbacks that are directly awaited for responsiveness.

    Lock-free:
        - Ensure there are no await calls in critical paths.

    Hot path complexity:
        - sticky session lookup is O(1)
        - min load tracking/lookup is O(1)
        - load balancing for new sessions is O(k) where k = workers tied at min load
        - credit sent/returned tracking is O(1)

    Cold path complexity:
        - worker register/unregister is O(n) where n = number of workers
        - credit cancellation is O(n × k) where n = number of workers, k = average in-flight credits per worker

        sent to it is never returned, which starves the concurrency limiter --
        throughput degrades with nothing naming the cause.

        Staleness is measured against ``last_heartbeat_ns``, NOT credit-channel
        traffic. Workers emit nothing on the credit channel while a request is
        in flight, so keying off that evicted healthy workers running long

        spread across the pool every busy worker was evicted in turn until
        routing had none left and the run hard-failed. Heartbeats are published
        on the worker's own timer regardless of request duration, so a slow
        worker keeps its clock fresh.

        Removing a worker that owns an in-flight credit or sticky session is
        terminal: the worker-local state cannot be restored by a late heartbeat.

        dies before its first heartbeat still ages out; a 0 here means the load
        entry was built outside ``_register_worker`` and is skipped, so a
        missing liveness feed degrades to no eviction rather than to evicting
