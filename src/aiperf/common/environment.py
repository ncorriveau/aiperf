Environment Configuration Module

Provides a hierarchical, type-safe configuration system using Pydantic BaseSettings.
All settings can be configured via environment variables with the AIPERF_ prefix.

Structure:
    Environment.ACCURACY.*       - Accuracy benchmark settings
    Environment.API_SERVER.*     - API server settings
    Environment.COMPRESSION.*    - Compression settings for streaming file transfers
    Environment.DATASET.*        - Dataset management
    Environment.DEV.*            - Development and debugging settings
    Environment.ENDPOINT.*       - Endpoint wire-format settings
    Environment.GPU.*            - GPU telemetry collection
    Environment.HTTP.*           - HTTP client socket and connection settings
    Environment.LOGGING.*        - Logging configuration
    Environment.METRICS.*        - Metrics collection and storage
    Environment.MLFLOW.*         - MLflow export settings
    Environment.OTEL.*           - OTel metrics streaming
    Environment.RECORD.*         - Record processing
    Environment.SEARCH_PLANNER.* - Adaptive-search planner tunables
    Environment.SERVER_METRICS.* - Server metrics collection
    Environment.SERVICE.*        - Service lifecycle and communication
    Environment.TIMING.*         - Timing manager settings
    Environment.TOKENIZER.*      - Tokenizer pre-warm and loading
    Environment.UI.*             - User interface settings
    Environment.WANDB.*          - Weights & Biases export settings
    Environment.WORKER.*         - Worker management and scaling
    Environment.ZMQ.*            - ZMQ communication settings

Examples:
    # Via environment variables:
    AIPERF_HTTP_SO_RCVBUF=20971520
    AIPERF_WORKER_CPU_UTILIZATION_FACTOR=0.8

    # In code:
