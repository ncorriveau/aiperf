"""Monotonic wall-clock timestamp source.

Captures ``time.time_ns()`` once as an anchor, then derives all subsequent
wall-clock timestamps from ``time.perf_counter_ns()`` deltas. This produces
timestamps that are:

- In the wall-clock domain (comparable across machines via shared Unix epoch)
- Monotonic (immune to NTP step corrections during a benchmark)
- High resolution (nanosecond, from perf_counter)

Used by both the controller (CreditIssuer) and workers (ClockOffsetTracker)
to ensure consistent, monotonic timestamps for cross-machine offset measurement.

class MonotonicClock:
    """Wall-clock source anchored to ``perf_counter`` for monotonicity.

    At construction, captures both ``time.time_ns()`` and ``time.perf_counter_ns()``.
    ``now_ns()`` then computes wall-clock time as::

        wall_anchor + (perf_counter_now - perf_anchor)

    This matches the dual-clock bootstrap pattern used throughout AIPerf's
    timing subsystem.

    Example:

        clock = MonotonicClock()
        request_start_ns = clock.now_ns()
        ...
        elapsed = clock.elapsed_sec()
