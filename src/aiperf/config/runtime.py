    # Why pod packing exists at all, and where the sizing numbers come from.
    #
    # A node has roughly 65k ephemeral ports, which caps the concurrent
    # connections any one node can hold open. That ceiling -- not CPU, not
    # memory -- is the reason the worker fleet is split across pods rather
    # than scaled up in place; it is the original motivation for the entire
    # Kubernetes deployment mode.
    #
    # The two ratios the design was sized against:
    #   ~500 concurrent connections per worker
    #   1 record processor per 4 workers  (see RECORD.PROCESSOR_SCALE_FACTOR)
    #
    # Both are starting points, not invariants -- they are recorded here
    # because the derivation had otherwise survived only in a design document
    # that no longer exists in any branch, leaving the defaults below looking
    # arbitrary.
