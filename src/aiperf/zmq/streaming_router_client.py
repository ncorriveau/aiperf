class ZMQStreamingRouterClient(BaseZMQClient):
    """
    ZMQ ROUTER socket client for bidirectional streaming with DEALER clients.

    Unlike ZMQRouterReplyClient (request-response pattern), this client is
    designed for streaming scenarios where messages flow bidirectionally without
    request-response pairing.

    Features:
    - Bidirectional streaming with automatic routing by peer identity
    - Message-based peer lifecycle tracking (ready/shutdown messages)
    - Works with both TCP and IPC transports

    Usage Pattern:
    - ROUTER sends messages to specific DEALER clients by identity
    - ROUTER receives messages from DEALER clients (identity included in envelope)
    - No request-response pairing - pure streaming
    - Supports concurrent message processing
    - Automatic peer tracking via worker ready and shutdown messages

    ```python
        from aiperf.common.structs import (
            Credit, WorkerDispatchable, WorkerShutdown, CreditReturn
        )

        # Create via comms (recommended - handles lifecycle management)
