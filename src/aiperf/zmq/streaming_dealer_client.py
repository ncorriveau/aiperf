class ZMQStreamingDealerClient(BaseZMQClient):
    """
    ZMQ DEALER socket client for bidirectional streaming with ROUTER.

    Unlike ZMQDealerRequestClient (request-response pattern), this client is
    designed for streaming scenarios where messages flow bidirectionally without
    request-response pairing.

    The DEALER socket sets an identity which allows the ROUTER to send messages back
    to this specific DEALER instance.

    ASCII Diagram:
    ┌──────────────┐                    ┌──────────────┐
    │    DEALER    │◄──── Stream ──────►│    ROUTER    │
    │   (Worker)   │                    │  (Manager)   │

    └──────────────┘                    └──────────────┘

    Usage Pattern:
    - DEALER connects to ROUTER with a unique identity
    - DEALER sends messages to ROUTER
    - DEALER receives messages from ROUTER (routed by identity)
    - No request-response pairing - pure streaming
    - Supports concurrent message processing

    Example:
    ```python
        from aiperf.common.structs import (
            Credit, CancelCredits, WorkerDispatchable, WorkerShutdown, CreditReturn
        )

        # Create via comms (recommended - handles lifecycle management)
        dealer = comms.create_streaming_dealer_client(
            address=CommAddress.CREDIT_ROUTER,
            identity="worker-1",

                    await dealer.send(CreditReturn(credit_id=credit.id))
                case CancelCredits(credit_ids=ids):
                    cancel_credits(ids)

        dealer.register_receiver(handle_message)

        # Lifecycle managed by comms
        await comms.initialize()
        await comms.start()
        await dealer.send(WorkerDispatchable(worker_id="worker-1"))
        ...
