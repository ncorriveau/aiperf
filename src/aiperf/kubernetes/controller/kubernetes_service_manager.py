"""Kubernetes service manager for AIPerf.

This module provides a hybrid ServiceManager implementation that:
- Treats control-plane services as sibling Kubernetes containers
- Treats workers and record processors as external Kubernetes pods
- Monitors pod health with container-level detail (OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff, etc.)

This enables Kubernetes mode to run one container per control-plane service
while workers remain separate worker pods managed by JobSet.

    Treats control-plane services as sibling containers in the controller pod,

    Maintains a pod registry that tracks per-pod health, container states, and
