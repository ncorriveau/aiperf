"""Sweep-controller pod entry point.

Reads its target AIPerfSweep CR from the apiserver, builds a BenchmarkPlan,
runs MultiRunOrchestrator with K8sChildJobExecutor, runs aggregate_and_export
once all variations are done, publishes terminal status, and exits.

Idempotent: a restart re-reads the CR, sees existing terminal children
(ownerRef + label match), and resumes from the first non-existent variation.
If a complete epoch bundle is already marked ready, the controller republishes
status directly without replaying children or rebuilding temporary artifacts.

    """Resolve the AIPerfSweep terminal ``status.phase`` from child outcomes.

    Three-way classification keeps a single bad trial in a 6-trial sweep from
    masquerading as a total run-failure:

    * ``Cancelled`` — the parent CR requested cancellation, OR no genuine
      failures occurred but at least one child was cancelled and none
      succeeded; partial child results still feed aggregate artifacts.
    * ``Succeeded`` — no failures.
    * ``Failed`` — every result failed (no successful trial), OR
      ``max_failures > 0`` and ``failed >= max_failures`` (explicit budget),
      OR ``on_child_failure == "abort"`` and any genuine failure occurred
      (the abort policy is terminal-fatal even when a prior child succeeded).
    * ``PartiallyFailed`` — some failed, some succeeded, and neither the
      explicit budget nor the abort policy was tripped.

    The CRD enum (``crd-aiperfsweep.yaml``) has carried ``PartiallyFailed``
    since the schema was first written, but every prior call site collapsed
    "any failure" → ``Failed``. ``aiperf kube list`` already
    accept the enum verbatim because the CRD declared it.

    Cancelled children (a user cancelling individual child AIPerfJobs out of
    band, so the parent's ``spec.cancel`` never flips) are NOT failures: they
    are counted separately via ``cancelled`` and excluded from ``failed`` by
    the caller, mirroring the operator rollup's distinct ``cancelled`` bucket
    (``child_rollup``). Folding them into ``failed`` let an externally
    cancelled sweep trip ``failed >= max_failures`` and resolve ``Failed``.

    Args:
        completed: Count of successful child results across all (variation,
            trial) cells. Sourced from ``RunResult.success`` truthiness.
        failed: Count of genuinely failed child results across all cells
            (child Job ``Failed``). Cancelled children are excluded — they
            are passed via ``cancelled`` instead.
        max_failures: ``spec.failurePolicy.maxFailures`` from the CR.
            ``0`` = unbounded (no explicit threshold; use the all-failed
            rule). ``>0`` = treat ``failed >= max_failures`` as
            non-recoverable.
        cancel_requested: Whether ``spec.cancel`` was observed during the run.
        cancelled: Count of child results whose terminal phase was
            ``Cancelled`` (out-of-band per-child cancellation).
        on_child_failure: ``spec.failurePolicy.onChildFailure`` from the CR.
            ``"abort"`` makes the first genuine failure terminal-fatal — the
            orchestrator stops issuing further children, so the sweep is
            ``Failed`` even with a prior success and the default
            ``max_failures=0``. ``"continue"`` (default) leaves resolution to
            the all-failed / budget rules above.

    Returns:
        One of ``"Cancelled"``, ``"Succeeded"``, ``"PartiallyFailed"``,
        ``"Failed"`` — members of ``PARENT_TERMINAL_PHASES`` in
        ``aiperf.operator.handlers.sweep.child_rollup``.

    Example:
        >>> resolve_terminal_phase(completed=5, failed=1, max_failures=0)
        'PartiallyFailed'
        >>> resolve_terminal_phase(completed=0, failed=6, max_failures=0)

    The sweep-controller writes aggregate artifacts under

    ``children.json``) and the strategy-owned aggregate dir (typically
    ``<base>/aggregate/profile_export_aiperf_aggregate.json``). On small
    sweeps the bundle is ~50 KB and we embed everything inline on the CR
    to close the live half of the dual-backed sweep API contract
    documented in ``aggregator.py``.

    On large sweeps (many cells x metrics x percentiles) the strategy
    ``confidence`` payload grows linearly and the patch can exceed the
    apiserver's 1 MB CR size cap, returning 413 and stranding the parent
    at ``Aggregating``. We bound the inlined size: if the encoded bundle
    exceeds ``AIPERF_K8S_JOBSET_SWEEP_AGGREGATE_INLINE_MAX_BYTES`` we drop
    ``confidence`` first,
    then omit ``children`` and add a compact ``childrenTruncated`` marker
    if the post-drop payload still exceeds the budget. The disk-backed
    path served by the results sidecar still has the full document, so
    consumers fetching ``status.aggregateRef.apiPath`` see no loss; only
    the in-CR mirror is reduced.

    Missing files are silently skipped: this loader is best-effort and the
    primary signal (``aggregation.phase=Complete`` and ``terminal_phase``)
