"""Sweep-level aggregate JSON writer.

The sweep-controller calls :func:`write_sweep_aggregate` exactly once when the
parent ``AIPerfSweep`` enters a terminal phase. It writes
``<base>/<ns>/sweeps/<name>/<sweep_run_epoch>/aggregate.json`` (and optionally
``conditions.json``) atomically via a sibling ``.tmp`` + ``os.replace`` so a
torn read on the operator HTTP API side surfaces as ``JSONDecodeError`` rather
than a half-decoded dict. ``latest.txt`` is updated *last* so a partial-state
crash never shadows a prior good epoch.

This file is the durable anchor of the dual-backed sweep API: the operator
reads from the CR while live and from the per-epoch directory once the sweep
has finished and the controller pod is gone.

    By default, writes ``latest.txt`` last so a torn read on the operator side
    sees the prior epoch (or nothing) but never a half-written current epoch.
    Callers that write additional required siblings after ``aggregate.json`` can
    pass ``update_latest=False`` and advance the pointer after their full bundle
    is durable. ``conditions.json`` is only written when ``conditions`` is not
    ``None`` (callers that have not yet collected the conditions list pass
    ``None`` and the file is omitted).

        doc: Pre-assembled aggregate document. Shape is owned by the caller —
            this writer is intentionally schema-agnostic.
        conditions: Optional list of CR-style condition dicts; wrapped under a
            ``{"conditions": [...]}`` envelope on disk.
