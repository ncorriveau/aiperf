"""A worker that stops answering must stop receiving credits.

Documented 2026-03-09 and still open: the sticky router only dropped a worker
on an explicit WorkerShutdown, so a pod that died without one kept being
selected. Every credit routed to it was never returned, which starves the
concurrency limiter -- throughput degrades silently with nothing in the logs
naming the cause.

A dead worker cannot report its own death, so detection has to be router-side.
It must NOT be based on credit-channel silence: a worker emits nothing between
its FirstToken and its CreditReturn, so a reasoning model with a minute of
decode is indistinguishable from a crashed pod, and evicting on that killed
healthy workers one at a time until routing had none left. Detection keys off
service heartbeats, which the worker publishes on its own timer regardless of
what request it is running. Eviction is terminal when active worker-local work
would be lost.
