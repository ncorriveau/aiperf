"""The streaming DEALER/ROUTER protocols must declare what callers actually use.

Two ways a Protocol goes wrong without any type checker complaining:

* it omits a method the implementation has and callers depend on, so a
  conforming implementation silently loses a feature (``request``); and
* it declares a return type the implementation contradicts, so a conforming
  handler cannot do the one thing the protocol's own ``request_to`` needs it
  to do (``register_receiver`` returning a reply ``Struct``).

Both were live here. These tests pin the declared surface against the ZMQ
implementations that back it.
